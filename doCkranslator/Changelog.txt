0.0.4:(July/16/2010): doCkranslator now translates from lots of languages, and it can be defined by the configuration file. Input box now shows a label with source and destination languages.
0.0.3:(July/16/2010): Refactoring the code a lil bit. The user can define the resulting language by configuration file, so it won't change every time the plug-in reloads.
0.0.2: (July/15/2010): Fixing a lack of UTF-8 URL encoding, and the space encoding. Creating the "To" sub-menu instead of using the default one to place the target languages. Middle-click now fills the input dialog with the clipboard content resulting in a faster way to use the applet, thanks SQP for this suggestion.
0.0.1: (July/14/2010): doCkranslator has begun here. It translates from English to a lot of languages.
