0.2.0:(February/17/2011): Using CDApplet interface. Improving, and fixing the dictionary, added some unknown word types when fetching dictionary. Not always one word means that dictionary will be returned.

0.1.7:(January/16/2011): Added the Web Page translation. Entering a URL, the translated page is loaded in the current web browser.
0.1.6:(January/14/2011): Added the dictionary functionality. If there is only one word to be translated, show the dictionary with the possible translations in categories.
0.1.5:(October/27/2010): Added a string pre-processing to remove the possible line breaks in the text to be translated. Changed the shortcuts, both the X-server, and the Dock one were set to Ctrl+Alt[W|R]
0.1.4:(August/24/2010): For Cairo-dock 2.2.0 or higher, the user can move from the translation result to a new translation, or edit the recently translated text.
0.1.3:(August/23/2010): Adding the dock-level shortcut Ctrl + F9, requires Cairo-Dock 2.2.0 or higher. Removing glib import since it was redundant and causing problems in Debian Lenny.

0.1.1:(July/18/2010): Switch languages menu added, thanks to Matttbe for this suggestion. util module added.
0.1.0:(July/18/2010): doCkranslator now has another fast-as-hell way to translate. Press Ctrl + F8 to open the input dialog, paste some text, and press Enter. The shortcut capability requires Python-Xlib, but even if the user has not it, the applet works without this capability.
0.0.5:(July/16/2010): Source language now can be defined by context menu. doCkranslator now has a fast way to translate, select any text and middle-click on the icon, just it.
0.0.4:(July/16/2010): doCkranslator now translates from lots of languages, and it can be defined by the configuration file. Input box now shows a label with source and destination languages.
0.0.3:(July/16/2010): Refactoring the code a lil bit. The user can define the resulting language by configuration file, so it won't change every time the plug-in reloads.
0.0.2: (July/15/2010): Fixing a lack of UTF-8 URL encoding, and the space encoding. Creating the "To" sub-menu instead of using the default one to place the target languages. Middle-click now fills the input dialog with the clipboard content resulting in a faster way to use the applet, thanks SQP for this suggestion.
0.0.1: (July/14/2010): doCkranslator has begun here. It translates from English to a lot of languages.
