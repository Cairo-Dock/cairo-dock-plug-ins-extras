INSTALLATION:
-------------

1) The name of this applet is "HDDtemperature"; it is placed in a folder  "~/.config/cairo-dock/third-party"

So, files in "~/.config/cairo-dock/third-party/HDDtemperature" directory are:

"auto-load.conf"      : the file describing the applet
"icon"                : the default icon of the applet
"HDDtemperature"      : the python script, without extension
"HDDtemperature.sh"   : the script in bash, actually applet's code
"HDDtemperature.conf" : the config file of the applet
"preview"             : a preview of the applet


2) Make the files "HDDtemperature" and "HDDtemperature.sh" executable:

   chmod a+x ~/.config/cairo-dock/third-party/HDDtemperature/HDDtemperature

   chmod a+x ~/.config/cairo-dock/third-party/HDDtemperature/HDDtemperature.sh


3) Check whether 'hddtemp' daemon is running:

   ps -f -C hddtemp

If no, start it:

   service hddtemp start

(Read more about 'hddtemp' utility in its manual)


4) Turn the applet on and customize it (if you wish) in the "System" section of "Configure" menu of Cairo-Dock.
