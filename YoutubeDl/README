Details:
This applet allows a user to drag Youtube links from the Youtube website and 
drop them on the icon to download. The backend downloader is based on 
youtube-dl.py.  If you have python-tk installed on your system saving and 
loading url lists will be done using a graphical dialog box, otherwise you 
need to set the directory path in the configuration and just enter the filename
in the popup box.  If you have pynotify installed on your system you have the 
option of letting the notification area of your desktop handle the alerts, 
otherwise alerts will be done using the cairo-dock popup messages. You can 
turn this feature on or off under the configuration.  Currently the url list 
is not editable from the dock but if you save the list to a file you can edit 
with a text editor then load the list back into the plugin. Downloading can 
be paused from the context menu of the icon and you can choose to have 
downloads start automatically in the configuration area.  The left click button
on the mouse brings up the current url list and the middle button can be 
configured for different actions.
