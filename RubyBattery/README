In order to use this applet, it is necessary to install Ruby, Rubygems and the gems rbus and parseconfig.

# Installation process

* Ruby: sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev ruby1.8 ri1.8 rdoc1.8 irb1.8 libreadline-ruby1.8 libruby1.8
* Rubygems: Instructions are neatly described in http://rubygems.org/pages/download
* Gem Rbus: (sudo) gem install rbus
* Gem parseconfig: (sudo) gem install parseconfig

# Tips

When running Cairo-Dock through terminal, for example, cairo-dock -c, check if any message regarding execution permission is being shown. If so, set execution permission to the applet, chmod a+x 755 RubyBatter

# Gauge

By default, the gauge being used is the Battery one. Anyway, I made a gauge specifically to this applet. It is a cute ruby being filled as the battery charge increases and emptied as the battery charge decreases. :-)

In order to use it, just do the following:

* 1 - Open the RubyBattery.conf and in the last line change the "theme = Battery" to "theme = Ruby-Battery"
* 2 - In the folder RubyBattery (the one of this README) there is a folder called Ruby-Battery in which the gauge files are. What you need is just copy this folder and paste it in the /usr/share/cairo-dock/gauges directory.
* 3 - If the applet was already being used, just remove it from the dock and set it up to the dock again to reload the gauge.
